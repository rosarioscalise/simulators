## Why simulators?
- training policies with reinforcement-learning methods
- identifying system parameters via gradient-based regression
- generating datasets for learning
- differentiable model representations in model-predictive-control frameworks
- general Monte Carlo testing and validation
- avoiding damaging physical platforms by prototyping in sim
